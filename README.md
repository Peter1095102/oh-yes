# **oh-yes**
a pretty much useless discord bot with over 10 commands lol

## **how 2 config**
rename the file called config-template.json to config.json, put it in the folder where the bot folder is and change what you want

## **how 2 test** (~~totally not advertising~~)
do you want to see the bot in action but don't want to download anything? join  [our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VgwTUjx)

"but why do i have to join a server, why can't i just invite the bot?"
well, the bot is currently made for a single server, but you can download the source if you want to test it out in your own server
